This is my solution to HW5.

## Problem 2

Load the data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and
an experimental arm, the file names include the subject ID and arm.

``` r
longitudinal_path = "./data"
longitudinal_files = list.files(longitudinal_path)

longitudinal_data = 
  longitudinal_files %>% 
  purrr::map(~ read_csv(file.path(longitudinal_path, .))) %>% 
  reduce(rbind)
```
