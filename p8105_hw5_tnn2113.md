This is my solution to HW5.

## Problem 2

Load the data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and
an experimental arm, the file names include the subject ID and arm.

``` r
longitudinal_path = "./data"
longitudinal_files = list.files(longitudinal_path)

longitudinal_data = 
  longitudinal_files %>% 
  purrr::map(~ read_csv(file.path(longitudinal_path, .))) %>% 
  reduce(rbind)
```

``` r
longitudinal_df = 
  longitudinal_data %>% 
  mutate(subject_id = as.numeric(regmatches(longitudinal_files, regexpr( "\\d+", longitudinal_files))),
         arm = substr(longitudinal_files, start = 1, stop = 3)
  ) %>% 
  relocate(arm, subject_id, everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation_values"
  )
```

The following code chunk shows the spaghetti plot displaying the
observations on each subject over time. Over the course of 8 weeks,
there were not a lot of changes in observation values in the control arm
participants. However, there seemed to be an increase of observation
values after week 4 in overall observation values in the experimental
arm participants.

``` r
longitudinal_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation_values, group = subject_id, color = arm)) + 
  geom_path()
```
